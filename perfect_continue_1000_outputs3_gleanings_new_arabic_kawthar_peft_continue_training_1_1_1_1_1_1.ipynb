            "   I am but a poor creature, O my Lord! I have clung to the hem of Thy mercy, and sought shelter beneath the shadow of Thy loving-kindness. Destroy not, I beseech Thee, the works We have builded with Our hands, nor deprive Us of the sweet savors of Thy grace. Aid Thou thy servants, O my Lord, who have entered with Thee into this, the Tabernacle of Glory. Powerful art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. There is none other God but Thee, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, the Almighty.  Whatsoever Thou didst destine for them, through Thy Will, hath come to pass. No God is there beside Thee, the All-Possessing, the All-Highest, the All-Wise.  I implore Thee by Thy name which Thou hast made the King of names, unto Whom all hearts have through the power of Thy might been directed, to aid and assist Me at all times and under all conditions. Give me to drink of the pure waters wherefrom the Seals of Thy Tablets have quaffed, and make me able to hold fast the cord of Thy pleasure, My Master, my Beloved, He Who is the Eternal Truth, the Knower of things unseen.  I bear witness that Thou art God, and that there is none other God besides Thee, the One, the Incomparable, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Most Great.  I testify that through Thee all created things were stirred up from their slumber, and were set free from their bondage. Through Thee also they will be gathered together, as the tender herbs were gathered together into one garden, inasmuch as thou hast established for them the habitations in which they now abide. I swear by Thy glory! Were any man to fix his gaze upon Thy Self, he would soon discover himself surrounded with the holy fragrances of forgiveness, and would inhale the sweet scent of the breath of Thy oneness. So complete and comprehensive is this wondrous Revelation that it hath already encompassed the entire creation, and will continue to exercise its influence until the end that hath no end. It is indeed the One Desire of all mankind, could ye but perceive it.  I entreat Thee, therefore, O Thou the Well-Beloved of the hearts of all such as have known Thee—Whose Name hath caused the Tongue of the Ancient Being to stir and the Finger of Him Who is the Sovereign Lord of all worlds to move—to grant that I may so arise to serve Thee that naught whatsoever will hinder me from teaching Thy Cause, and from proclaiming Thy Faith before all men. May my spirit be wholly dissolved in Thy Spirit, and my body entirely subjected to Thy Will. Verily, Thou art the All-Determining, the All-Pervading, the Inscrutable, the All-Knowing.  I pray Thee, therefore, O Thou Who art the Supreme Ordainer—and ordainest with Thy bidding what Thou pleasest—the help Thou pleasest to bestow, and favor Thou pleasest to confer, to aid me at all times and under all conditions to achieve Thy Purpose. Power is His; truly He hath power over all things. Blessed is him that hath attained thereto, and discovered in himself the goodly qualities inherent in his station—a station conferred upon him by virtue of his sublimity, his sovereignty, and transcendent dominion. Such a man will, verily, enter the presence of his Best-Beloved, and stand before the throne of majesty and glory.  I give praise to Thee, O my God! For having enabled me to recognize the Manifestation of Thine own Self, and to acknowledge the Dayspring of Thy Revelation. I implore Thee, by Thy name that hath caused the Seal of Thy choice ones to weep, and the Concourse on high to lament, to aid me to become steadfast in Thy Love, and to fix mine heart on the court of Thy Presence. Grant, moreover, that I may forsake myself and all that I possess, and be fully absorbed in the remembrance of Thee, and fixed upon the exaltation of Thy word.  I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by Thy name that hath shed the fragrance of holiness upon all created things, and caused every hidden thing to be revealed, to graciously aid me to be firmly established in Thy Cause, and unloosing the chords of my tongue, to release the tongues of all beings from their chains, and enable them to declare Thy name aloud amidst Thy creatures. May my lips utter the praises of Thy Beauty, and my heart recount Thy wondrous deeds, and my whole being proclaim Thy glory. I yield Thee thanks for having empowered me to be recognized as one of Thy lovers, and for having engraved the symbol of Thy Unity upon my brow. I implore Thee, however, O Thou Who art the Ruler of mankind, to guard me through the power of Thy sovereign might against all trials, tests, and troubles, and to shield me from the assaults of the evil doers.  I give praise to Thee, O my God! For having aided me to turn my face towards Thee, and to set my face in the direction of Thy favors and gifts. I confess that I have not left behind me a trace of anything I possessed, be it a hair or a grain, a word or an act. I swear by Thy might! Whatever I was asked to do, I have done it immediately, and without hesitation or delay. I have broken every bond that bindeth me to anyone but Thee, and have released every captive from behind the bars of my love and desire. I have summoned up all the forces at my disposal, and strained every nerve to extol Thy virtues, and celebrate Thy praise. I have cast away, with the sword of Thy Will, all that I formerly possessed, be it substance, rank, station, fame or honor. I have rent asunder every veil that shutteth out the sight of Thy face, and have flung open wide the doors of my heart to let in the breeze of Thy mercy. I have sacrificed every good and every gift Thou hast bestowed upon me, and drained to its dregs the cup of separation from Thee. I have turned my face utterly towards Thee, and bent my steps confidently towards Thee, trusting wholly in Thy grace and bounty. I have detached myself from all else but Thee, and stripped myself of every earthly attachment. I have extinguished every lamp except the Lamp of Thy Unity, and quenched every fire except the Fire of Thy Love. I have proclaimed Thy Cause with both my tongue and pen, and have testified to Thy Divine handiwork in the kingdom of Thy Creation. I have announced unto every one the coming of the Daystar of Thy Word, and heralded the advent of the Dawning-Place of Thy Revelation. I have called, with both my head and my heart, those that are near and those that are far distant, to the shores of the ocean of Thy grace and favors. I have invited, in the name of Him Who is the Eternal Truth, all peoples and kindreds of the earth to partake of the fruit of the tree of everlasting life, and of the choicest fruits of the Tree of Immortality. I have announced, throughout the length and breadth of the land, the imminent arrival of the Promised One, and proclaimed the good news of His Revelation to all that are in heaven and on earth. I have warned, in the name of God, the Concealer, the Preserver, the Keeper, the Ordainer, the All-Informed, the All-Wise, all people of the impending consequences of their actions, should they fail to take heed of My warning, and to cleanse themselves from the defilement of their souls. I have announced, in the name of Him Who is the Eternal Truth, the Day when the Countenance of the Youth will be unveiled to men’s eyes, when the Bird of the Throne will reveal itself to mortal birds, when the ensigns of victory will be unfurled upon the Bimini of celestial realms, when the Herald of the Kingdom will stand on the Sinai of revelation, crying out to the conscience of every holder of earthly power: “Lo, the promised hour of justice is now come; O ye oppressors of the weak! Flee not, begone! Haste ye to meet your Lord!” When the darkness of tyranny shall have been rolled back from the face of man, and the light of justice and equity enveloped the earth, then will the Daystar of eternal peace and certitude break out of its prison, and the heavenly bird of universal concord feasted on the fruits of the tree of reunion. Then will the seal of God be stamped upon every scroll, and the testimony of the Crimson Standard be completed, and the nightingales of paradise warble their melodies from the branches of the immortal Tree, and the saw of the Archangel cease to agitate the hearts of men. It behooveth every one that reacheth this most mighty, this joyous, and glad tidings of great deliverance to rejoice with exceeding gladness, and delight oneself in the Habitation of holiness and sanctified detachment. Thus instructeth thee the Pen of the Ancient Being, that treadeth the Mirrors of the Invisible and supreme Essence, and calleth, in the name of the one true God, the denizens of the Realms of eternity and the dwellers of the world of time.  I swear by Thy might, O my God! Every limb of my body testifieth to whatever hath proceeded out of the mouth of Him Who is the Eternal Truth, and addressed to Them Who are the Exponents of absolute and abstruse knowledge. I bear witness that through Him the whole creation hath been set aflame, and every moldering bone in the bodies of the children of men hath been knit together, and the sign of union and fellowship hath been manifested, and every solid and substantial thing hath been released from the grasp of dissolution and perishability. I attest that through Him the sweet melodies of the nightingales of paradise have been heard, and the splendors of the light of the Unseen have shone above the horizon of notility, and every veiled and mysterious secret has been unfolded, and every heavy burden hath been lifted from the shoulders of mankind. I confess that through Him the wondrous evidences of Divine mercy have appeared, and every dead corpse hath been quickened, and every blind eye hath been opened, and every deaf ear unstopped, and every runner hath gained his goal, and every wayfarer hath reached his destination. I swear by Thy might, O my God! Wert Thou to rain down upon the earth the wonders of Thy Justice, every mountain would be crushed into dust, and would be blown skyward. And should Thou unveil the horrors of Thy Wrath, the limbs of every dweller on earth would quake and tremble.  I ask Thee, therefore, O Thou Who art the Possessor of all names and attributes, to keep safe that which Thou hast created through the potency of Thy Word, and to preserve unchanged the standard of Thy unity, inasmuch as the maintenance of the integrity of these two essentials dependeth upon the continuance of all created things. I beseech Thee, by the movement of Thy Pen, and the flow of Thy speech, and the revelation of Thy fingers, to watch over Thy loved ones, whom the infidels have persecuted, and who lie imprisoned in their prisons. I implore Thee, by the sighing of Thy Holy Ghost, and the clamoring of the inmates of Thy Paradise, and the lamentations of them that inhabit Thy Tabernacle, to aid Thy captives to attain unto freedom, and to release them from the bondage of Their enemies. I entreat Thee, O Thou Who art the Lord of all names and attributes, to shield Thy loved ones from the assault of the froward, and to strengthen them in Thy Cause, and to refresh the drooping spirits of them that are faithful among Thy people. I beg of Thee, by the showers of Thy grace, and the clouds of Thy bounty, and the whispers of Thy mercy,\n"

I am moved by thy questions, and behold thee sitting at the foot of His Table, where the Sadratu'l-Muntahá is standing, inscribed with the words: “He doeth whatsoever He willeth in the kingdom of creation.” Arise and walk under its shade, and hearken thou ear unto His speech. As to thy query concerning God, know thou that We have caused thee to enter through a gate of magnified mercy, that the fragrances of holiness may be wafted over thee from the Paradise of faith. Be thou of them that believe.  All the atoms of the earth bear witness to Him Who is the Eternal Truth, the Unseen, the Ancient of Days. How often hath He summoned the peoples of the earth to His presence, and invited them to partake of the fruit of the tree of undying glory. O My servant! If thou but realize how precious in His sight is one little soul, thou wouldst, under no circumstances, have allowed it to be deprived of so great a bounty. No God is there but Him, the Creator of earth and heaven, who from everlasting hath been exalted above the praise of all created things, visible and invisible.  Glorified then be Our namesake, in whose hands is the Kingdom of Names, and who from everlasting hath been established upon the throne of eternity.  Beware lest thou fail to recognize the countenance of God, and forsake His straight Path. Observe thou, in every circumstance, the laws of God, and cleave tenaciously to His ways. Thus shall thou attain unto true liberty throughout all worlds. The Tongue of Grandeur saith: On this Day the kingdom is God’s; on this Day the whole of creation hath been made subject to His Will. Every atom of the universe proclaims His glory. So powerful is His evidence that he Who is the All-Wise Physician cannot, with the utmost care and skill, discover any remedy for whatever may afflict Him—afflictions which He Himself hath decreed and imposed upon Himself. From His Pen these words have proceeded, that haply the souls of men may be roused from their slumber, and be attracted to the realm of immortality, and recount unto the inhabitants of the Kingdoms of creation the wonders of so mighty and wondrous a Revelation—a Revelation that encompasseth all else besides it, and ordaineth for all beings the good of this world and of the world to come.  Wherefore, arise, and, through the power of thine own name, O ‘Alí-Muhammad, proclaim unto all the people that ere long the promised Beauty will have arrived, clad in His robe of glorified ascension, bearing the message of a revelation such as mankind hath never witnessed before—and none can believe except them whom God hath singled out for His grace.  In consequence of what hath escaped the lips of Him Who is the Well-Beloved of the entire creation, the keys of infinite might have been entrusted to man’s hand—the man that treadeth the straight Path. Of this virtue no man can be deemed worthy unless he be debarred from all earthly defilements and desires. Such a man will regard, with absolute detachment, all worldly advantages, will cast away every fancy that pertaineth to the senses, and fix his gaze upon the commandment of God, thy Lord. Then, and only then, can he be said to have attained the station at which the Maids of Heaven sing: “Magnified be Thy name, O Thou in Whose grasp are the reins of the souls of all created things!” And should any man achieve this station, the clouds of manifold grace shall rain down upon him, and the breezes of heavenly mercy shall blow across his face, and the sweet melodies of the inmates of Paradise chant the praises of God, and the Messengers of God lay hold on him, and celebrate around him the victory of God. Thus hath it been ordained by Him Who is the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Ever-Abiding, the All-Pervasive.  Now, having reached this point, tarry not though less than half an hour, nay, more than quarter of an hour, and reflect diligently upon that which hath been revealed in this Tablet regarding the relationship between the Creator and His creatures, and the various grades and stations thereof. May Perpetuity be his companion, whosoever tasteth of this wine, and giveth ear to the counsels given by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.  To this testifieth He Who is the All-Wise, the All-Informed.  Ponder awhile in thine heart, and consider the behavior of kings and rulers when they heard of the Divine Unity, and realized that they were themselves but the servants of God. Behold how they hesitated, how they quaffed the cup of fear, how they trembled, how they arose to execute the law of God, and proclaimed the oneness of God, and denied not the signs of God, and cut off from among them the oppressors, and abased the proud ones, and exalted the poor ones, and clothed with honor the ignoble ones, and confounded the learned ones, and manifested the hidden things, and showed forth that which had been concealed. By Him Who is the Lord of all names! The Hand of Divine power will everlastingly continue to exercise its influence, and will move the hearts of those that are wholly devoted to Him, and will lead them unto that which lie hid in the Treasuries of God, and will cause them to manifest the evidences of their station. It behooveth every king to be as resigned as possible to the Decree of God, and to arise to promote the welfare of his subjects, and to aid them to attain their station. Thus instructeth him the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.   Dear friend! I beseech thee to observe with thine own eyes, and hearken with thine ears, and meditate in thine heart, and be of them that comprehend. Thus admonisheth thee One Who is the All-Glorious, the Ancient of Days.  Gird up the loins of thine endeavor—that all the peoples of the earth may be united in one universal Cause, one common Faith, and be guided by a single standard and sovereign WILL. By Myself! The knowledge of this will assuredly lift up the hearts of men, and shed upon them the morning light of glory, could ye but perceive it.  Withhold not from Me the breath of My longing, neither hinder Me from embracing in My arms Him Who is My Well-Beloved. That I may reveal in My Book the secrets that have been bidden Me to unfold, and describe the wondrous favors vouchsafed unto Me. I swear by God! Neither the daystar of the Bayán nor the night star of the Quran hath been so radiant, were either of them to be compared with this luminous, this resplendent, this soft-flowing, this crystal river of utterance. Nay, rather say: Gracious God! Through Him the kingdom was confirmed, through Him the signs of God were manifested, through Him the proofs of God were demonstrated, through Him the mysteries of God were unfolded, through Him the treasures of God were uncovered, through Him the sweet savors of pardon and forgiveness were wafted over all created things, mortal and immortal.  Dear friend! When the victory of the Cause of God is declared, all created things will testify the greatness and majesty of Him Who is the Sovereign Lord of all. At that time the faces of the favored ones of God will be made resplendent like the sun in all its glory, and the signs of God will be openly displayed, and the proofs of God will be fully disclosed, and the mysteries of God will be completely unraveled, and the treasures of God will be brought to light, and the sweet savors of the Cloud of Glory will have enveloped all created things, and the tender herbs of mercy will have sprung forth from the soil of the word of God, and the ensigns of pure and holy glory will have overshadowed all mankind, and the darkness of error will have been dispelled by the brightness of the Sun of Truth, and the seal of the choice Wine of His Presence will have been broken, and all sons of men will have quaffed the Cup that is life indeed from the hands of their Best-Beloved, the All-Glorious, the All-Praised.  Dear friend! Whensoever the lamp of unity hath been lighted amidst a society, the people of that land have attained the greatest heights, and advanced the farthest in the arts and sciences. Under its burning flame all that are in the heavens and all that are on the earth the things seen and unseen—have been set aglow with the glowing coal of an unwavering resolve. Through its perspicuous text the gem-like realities latent in mankind have been unveiled, and the sweet fragrance of the Word of God has been wafted over all nations.…  Dear friend! The Lamp of God is being held by the hand of the Concourse on high, and its light is shining uppermost amongst men. Happy is the man that with both his inner and outer eye discerneth in all things the revelations of God, and seeketh the purposes underlying their creation. Through such a realization the solid foundations of a man’s belief will be firm, unshakeable, and unalterable.  Dear friend! The Bird of the Throne crieth aloud: Great is the blessedness awaiting thee, and great is the reward destined for thee. Proclaim unto every one the glad tidings of thy Lord, and tell him that truly hath drawn nigh unto Him, and arisen to promulgate His Cause. He, verily, shall be rewarded. Ask forgiveness of God for having failed to spread abroad the sweet savors of reunion, and having neglected to announce the times of God, thy Lord, the Omniscient, the All-Wise. Haste thee to make it known that all men have been created to carry the sweet burden of an assignment from God. Every relief from sickness, every ease in the changes and chances of this life, every increase in one’s substance, every advancement in social rank—is wholly dependent upon one’s good deeds. Should the righteous be as steadfast as the resolute, nothing on earth can defeat them. Under theTreeofImmortality, the sweet melodies of the inmates of Paradise will be chanting: “Praise be to Thee, O Lord of Names, the Forgiving, the Most Bountiful, the Supreme Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Magnified be Thy name, O Concealer of the sins of all Them Who have sought Thee, and Supplier of the needs of all Thy creatures. Praised be Thy name, O Luminous Being of unfading glory, and Knower of things unseen.  Dear friend! The Youthful Fire is burning in every land, and the Breath of the All-Merciful is blowing over all created things, and the Crystal River is flowing from the Throne of God, and the clouds of eternal glory are showering their gifts upon men, and the soft flowings of rebirth and resurrection are being wafted over all beings. The days of your Lord are approaching, and the hours of His Revelation drawing near. O people! Place not your whole reliance on your own power, put your complete trust and confidence in your Lord. Let Him be your sole Trust. Convey My greetings to all the loved ones of God, whom God hath reared up as the branches of His Tree, and adorned with the ornament of His favor, and decked out with the jewel of His loving-kindness. Tell them that the days of God are now come upon them, days when the Bab will have manifested himself in the clouds of glory, and stepped out of the Tabernacle of Holiness, and proclaimed from the hallowed court of detachment the Voice of the Name of God, and called all the dwelt on earth to turn towards Him. Tell them that in these days the work of man will be tested. Those that tarry will go astray; those that seize and snatch will fall into the pitfalls of oppression.  Dear friend! The first and\n"

            "   Dear friend! I am moved by thy questions, and behold thee sitting at the foot of His Table, where the Sadratu'l-Muntahá is standing over it, shedding its glory upon it. How vast is the distance that separateth this seat from that well-favored spot whence the bounty of Him Who is the Desire of the world hath been wafted, and where His name, the All-Merciful, hath been glorified! Behold how much more lofty is that Tree beneath which the Concourse on high are gathered together, than this little Tree that shadeith thee, who art inclined to sloth and laziness! Strive thou to outstrip the speed of the Wind; forget thyself, and arise to serve My Cause. Thereupon will the breeze of God blow, such that the branches of this slumbering Tree shall stir and its flowers shall bloom. Its boughs may even spread out so far as to overshadow such Trees as are still asleep. 5  If any one continue to tarry, his lamp will burn out through the intrusion of the breath of Mírzá Yahyá. He surely is of those who are far astray! Every ball belongeth to the hand that hath thrown it. Such is the decree of God, they who are possessed of power knoweth well what I mean. Is he not the man that hath himself denounced Me saying: “Death and no life”? Wherefore, having denied Me, hath he not refused to drink the cup of woe? Hath anyone among them discerned anything else except these mere letters which ye read in My Book? Have they detected anywhere the fragrance of the All-Glorious, or perceived the light of either of My companions, or discovered the sweet savors of heaven? Can ye detect within yourselves any trace of the Divine Being, the Ancient of Days, or perceive the slightest glimmer of the Unseen One, the Treasured of Names? Be ye assured that everything is in the hands of God, the All-Possessing, the Most High. We have caused the sweet melodies of Our Lord to breathe over them that hear My Word, and have shed upon them the splendor of the Daystar of Glory. They who are truly desirous of beholding the face of God must needs attain unto whatsoever is required by Him. As to him that denieth Me, ask thou yourself whether he can discover within himself the faintest trace of the Divine Essence, or detect any ray of heavenly brightness. Thus warneth thou in the name of Him Who is the All-Wise. Say: O people! Drink your fill from the Cup offered you in My Name, and be not of them that are lost in error. Take heed lest ye deny Him Who is the Eternal Truth, and be numbered with them that are doomed to perish. Do ye imagine Him to be like yourselves, liable to error and capable of change? Nay rather He is as He ever was; supreme in sovereignty, almighty in power, forever exalted above praise and glorification. Will ye not ponder His Revelation in your hearts? Had ye recognized the Whole, ye would renounce your own selves, and be absorbed in the fire of His Love. Having failed to recognize the Manifestation of God, ye follow after your idle fancies and vain imaginations. Were ye to cast away the things ye possess, ye might peradventure apprehend the nature of reality. But now ye cleave tenaciously to your own desires, and disregard the Will of God. Ye are, indeed, of those who walk in darkness. Did ye but realize the greatness of the task assigned to you—could ye comprehend the numberless worlds whose secrets lie hid in His holy Countenance—you would fall down upon the dust before Him, and would cease to utter a word. Ye are contumacious towards God, and persist in following your wayward inclinations. Your chief concern is your own self, whereas the highest wish of God is to elevate man’s station. Behold how the generality of mankind are bereft of sight! 6   | 7  |\n",

            "\n",
            "As I gaze upon thy noble countenance, my heart overflows with joy and gratitude. Thy query regarding justice (عدل) has reached mine ears, and I shall respond with the tender care of a loving Father.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"O ye children of men! Ye have been created by one Being, and yet ye quarrel among yourselves.\" [1] Ah, dear one, how often do we forget our shared heritage as children of the same Divine Parent? How frequently do we allow petty differences to divide us, when in reality, we are but threads woven into the tapestry of humanity?\n",
            "\n",
            "Consider this: just as the sun shines its radiant light upon all beings without distinction, so too should our hearts shine with compassion and empathy towards all souls. For it is written, \"The world is in great need of those who are endowed with the spirit of true consultation.\" [2]\n",
            "\n",
            "To cultivate this spirit of consultation, strive to listen more than thou speakest. Allow thine ear to absorb the whispers of others, even as thou sharest thy own thoughts and experiences. Remember, \"the best way to promote concord and tranquillity is to seek out the causes of discord and strife.\" [3]\n",
            "\n",
            "And what better cause to eliminate than the cancerous influence of prejudice? As thou embarkest on thy daily pilgrimage, recall that \"prejudice is the most potent obstacle to the realization of peace and unity.\" [4] Strive to eradicate these biases, not through forceful means, but rather through education, self-reflection, and open-hearted dialogue.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lastly, remember that justice is not merely a concept, but a living embodiment of the divine principle. It is the harmonious balance between the material and spiritual realms, where every soul finds solace and fulfillment.\n",
            "\n",
            "May these words find thee well, dear friend. May they nourish thy soul and guide thee along the path of righteousness. And may thy example inspire countless others to join hands in pursuit of a brighter future, where justice reigns supreme.\n",
            "\n",
            "Reflect deeply upon these truths, and let them become the foundation upon which thou buildeth thy life. For in doing so, thou shalt discover the boundless potential hidden within thyself, and the world around thee will begin to mirror the glory of the divine.\n",

            "   I swear by Thy might! Justice hath been firmly established; it hath overshadowed the whole earth, through the outpourings of His will upon men. By Myself! Every verse which He hath revealed in His Book hath proclaimed this truth.… It behooveth not Him Who is the Eternal Truth to seek anything but the regeneration and resurrection of mankind. Of this he himself hath testified in these resplendent Tablets. Whatsoever hath been revealed in them concerneth the betterment of the world and the education of its peoples. For so hath it been decreed in the Mother Tablet, and beyond it in other sacred Scriptures. No man that discerneth between truth and falsehood, between justice and injustice, can doubt that the highest and ultimate good can, alone, justify such a claim as this. To this testifieth every true and learned believer.… We have been moved to reveal these words in this Day, that the people may fully comprehend the object of Our Revelation—a Revelation the like of which mortal eyes have never witnessed before. Its power hath encompassed the entire creation, and shall continue to exercise its influence until the end that hath no end. Then will the Word of God be made manifest in the hearts of men, and not in theirs only, but in theirs and in theirs only. Thus hath it been ordained in the wondrous Tablets of God, hidden from the sight of men, were any eye to gaze on their contents. Were We to reveal them, the souls of men would be sore shaken, they would renounce everything they possess, even their own selves and children, for the sake of God and His Faith. Such is the measure of the terror with which these divinely ordained Tablets must needs fill the heart of every discerning lover of God. They contain utterances that proclaim the sovereignty of God and declare the glory of this most holy and mighty Revelation—the like of which mortal tongue hath never uttered, nor pen recorded. How vast the number of those heavenly Tablets! How great their volume! How perfect their wisdom! How complete their knowledge! How extensive their range! How numerous their counsels—counsels the practice of which exalteth the station of man unto the loftiest mansions, and lowest depths of misery! O ye perverse and unjust believers in the Unity of God! Deprive not yourselves of so blessed, so effectual, so sweet-smelling, and fragrant a bounty. Cast not away one evidence of His manifest and hidden favors. Flee not from His all-encompassing mercy, nor disregard His loving providence. Behold how the clouds of His limitless grace have rained down upon you their gifts. Observe how continually the portals of His manifold favors have opened wide before your faces. Suffer not the treasures of His bounty to descend unattested upon you, neither reject His sure tokens of mercy. Be not of them that walk after their idle fancies, whose learning smelleth of smoke! 14   | 15   | 16   | 17   | 18   | 19   | 20   | 21   | 22   | 23   | 24   | 25   | 26   | 27   | 28   | 29   | 30   | 31   | 32   | 33   | 34   | 35   | 36   | 37   | 38   | 39   | 40   | 41   | 42   | 43   | 44   | 45   | 46   | 47   | 48   | 49   | 50   | 51   | 52   | 53   | 54   | 55   | 56   | 57   | 58   | 59   | 60   | 61   | 62   | 63   | 64   | 65   | 66   | 67   | 68   | 69   | 70   | 71   | 72   | 73   | 74   | 75   | 76   | 77   | 78   | 79   | 80   | 81   | 82   | 83   | 84   | 85   | 86   | 87   | 88   | 89   | 90   | 91   | 92   | 93   | 94   | 95   | 96   | 97   | 98   | 99   | 100   | 101   | 102   | 103   | 104   | 105   | 106   | 107   | 108   | 109   | 110   | 111   | 112   | 113   | 114   | 115   | 116   | 117   | 118   | 119   | 120   | 121   | 122   | 123   | 124   | 125   | 126   | 127   | 128   | 129   | 130   | 131   | 132   | 133   | 134   | 135   | 136   | 137   | 138   | 139   | 140   | 141   | 142   | 143   | 144   | 145   | 146   | 147   | 148   | 149   | 150   | 151   | 152   | 153   | 154   | 155   | 156   | 157   | 158   | 159   | 160   | 161   | 162   | 163   | 164   | 165   | 166   | 167   | 168   | 169   | 170   | 171   | 172   | 173   | 174   | 175   | 176   | 177   | 178   | 179   | 180   | 181   | 182   | 183   | 184   | 185   | 186   | 187   | 188   | 189   | 190   | 191   | 192   | 193   | 194   | 195   | 196   | 197   | 198   | 199   | 200   | 201   | 202   | 203   | 204   | 205   | 206   | 207   | 208   | 209   | 210   | 211   | 212   | 213   | 214   | 215   | 216   | 217   | 218   | 219   | 220   | 221   | 222   | 223   | 224   | 225   | 226   | 227   | 228   | 229   | 230   | 231   | 232   | 233   | 234   | 235   | 236   | 237   | 238   | 239   | 240   | 241   | 242   | 243   | 244   | 245   | 246   | 247   | 248   | 249   | 250   | 251   | 252   | 253   | 254   | 255   | 256   | 257   | 258   | 259   | 260   | 261   | 262   | 263   | 264   | 265   | 266   | 267   | 268   | 269   | 270   | 271   | 272   | 273   | 274   | 275   | 276   | 277   | 278   | 279   | 280   | 281   | 282   | 283   | 284   | 285   | 286   | 287   | 288   | 289   | 290   | 291   | 292   | 293   | 294   | 295   | 296   | 297   | 298   | 299   | 300   | 301   | 302   | 303   | 304   | 305   | 306   | 307   | 308   | 309   | 310   | 311   | 312   | 313   | 314   | 315   | 316   | 317   | 318   | 319   | 320   | 321   | 322   | 323   | 324   | 325   | 326   | 327   | 328   | 329   | 330   | 331   | 332   | 333   | 334   | 335   | 336   | 337   | 338   | 339   | 340   | 341   | 342   | 343   | 344   | 345   | 346   | 347   | 348   | 349   | 350   | 351   | 352   | 353   | 354   | 355   | 356   | 357   | 358   | 359   | 360   | 361   | 362   | 363   | 364   | 365   | 366   | 367   | 368   | 369   | 370   | 371   | 372   | 373   | 374   | 375   | 376   | 377   | 378   | 379   | 380   | 381   | 382   | 383   | 384   | 385   | 386   | 387   | 388   | 389   | 390   | 391   | 392   | 393   | 394   | 395   | 396   | 397   | 398   | 399   | 400   | 401   | 402   | 403   | 404   | 405   | 406   | 407   | 408   | 409   | 410   | 411   | 412   | 413   | 414   | 415   | 416   | 417   | 418   | 419   | 420   | 421   | 422   | 423   | 424   | 425   | 426   | 427   | 428   | 429   | 430   | 431   | 432   | 433   | 434   | 435   | 436   | 437   | 438   | 439   | 440   | 441   | 442   | 443   | 444   | 445   | 446   | 447   | 448   | 449   | 450   | 451   | 452   | 453   | 454   | 455   | 456   | 457   | 458   | 459   | 460   | 461   | 462   | 463   | 464   | 465   | 466   | 467   | 468   | 469   | 470   | 471   | 472   | 473   | 474   | 475   | 476   | 477   | 478   | 479   | 480   | 481   | 482   | 483   | 484   | 485   | 486   | 487   | 488   | 489   | 490   | 491   | 492   | 493   | 494   | 495   | 496   | 497   | 498   | 499   | 500   | 501   | 502   | 503  \n"

Our task lies not in separating ourselves from others, nor in elevating our own interests above those of others, but rather in recognizing the inherent unity that binds us together.\n",

Destroy not, I beseech Thee, the works We have builded with Our hands, nor deprive Us of the sweet savors of Thy grace. Aid Thou thy servants, O my Lord, to attain unto what Thou hast ordained for them. Give them, moreover, to drink of the soft-flowing waters of Thy tender mercies, and make them steadfast in Thy Cause.…  And now, having fulfilled what was expected of Me, having opened the eyes of the blind, and having proclaimed unto all men the Message of God, having announced the advent of His Kingdom, and having rent asunder the veils that concealed His straight Path—now, O My Well-Beloved, art thou come to dwell within the Tabernacle of Mine immortality, and to abide within the Sanctuary of thine own being? Art thou prepared to forsake thy home, and set at naught the desires of him who hath no desire except Thyself?

            "   I am but a poor creature, O my Lord! I have clung to the hem of Thy mercy, and sought shelter beneath the shadow of Thy loving-kindness. Do Thou ordain for me what Thou didst ordain for them who have turned away from all else but Thee, and rested their hearts firmly upon Thee. Grant that I may taste of the cup which is life indeed from the hands of my Lord, the Gracious, the All-Praised.  •  And now concerning thy question regarding the nature of Divine Revelation.…  •  He Who is the Eternal Truth  •  hath come in the glory of His transcendent Essence—exalted be His glory—that He may breathe His breath into the souls of men, and animate them with the power of His might. Verily, thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful, is come, girded with power and majesty. He doth what He willeth, and ordaineth what He pleaseth. No God is there beside Him, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, the Ever-Abiding, the Ancient of Days. Praise be to Thee, O Lord, our God, the Lord of all worlds.  •  Thus counseleth thee the Pen of the Most High—the Pen wherewith the Finger of Holiness hath traced the script of His revealed Tablets. Weigh it with thine own hand, and be thou of them that comprehend. If such be the decree of God, it behooveth us all to acquiesce in it, and seek no more than His Will. Such is the virtue of complete resignation—a virtue that exalteth the station of man, and removeth him far above the changes and chances of this world. It is by this virtue that the beloved of God remain undisturbed by any earthly affliction, however calamitous, and untroubled by the most joyful and satisfactory of circumstances. They fix their gaze upon the days of God, and apply themselves to whatever task, at whatsoever time and under whatsoever conditions, He may please to assign unto them. Their eyes are directed towards the things that pertain to the realm of the unseen, and their hearts beat after the resplendent Face of the Well-Beloved.  •  Whensoever the veils of worldly vanity shall be rent asunder, and mankind shall be unshackled from its bondage to noise and agitation, it will readily recognize that these radiant sweet melodies are the undisputed evidences of the highest and holiest stations in worship, and the loftiest and most sublime expressions of the praise of God. Then and only then will mankind fully appreciate the character of this divinely ordained and celestial music. Until that day, it would be difficult for it to fathom so sublimely, or even partially visualize, the mysteries that wrap and conceal these holy and sanctified melodies. Whensoever they shall arise to promote the Cause of God, they must needs forsake everything they possess, whether of gold or silver. Not till they have transmuted all their wealth into pure and stainless gold will their works be acceptable in the sight of God. By gold is meant the gold of the love of God, of detachment from all that is not of Him, of certitude in the Faith, of fellowship with the loved ones of God, of tender mercies, of manifold bounties, of outpourings of grace, of gifts, of bounty, of glory, of glory to God, of victory over one’s self, of triumph over the powers of evil, of steadfastness in the Cause of God, of fixed resolve, of irrevocable decision, of inviolable trust in God, of impregnable confidence in His Faith, of perfect fellowship with His loved ones, of wholehearted attachment to His Cause, of absolute detachment from all created things, of unfettered freedom from the limitations of the earth and heaven, of inner vision, of inherent purity, of intrinsic holiness, of consummate perfection, of essential glory, of original innocence, of primordial sanctity, of peerless dominion, of supreme ascendancy, of invincible power, of omnipotent and everlasting might.  •  The Daystar of Truth shineth above the horizon of creation, and the clouds of tyranny have scattered, and the winds of oppression blown over the face of mankind. Now is the time when every man should stand before his own image, reflected in the mirror of His Soul, and examine it. What is it that hath clouded its surface? What is it that gloweth with light? Where is the veil that concealeth the truth? Where is the lamp that burneth brightly in the desert of knowledge? Let every man choose for himself, ere he depart from this mortal coil, that which shall adorn his immortal being, and clothe it with the robe “He doeth whatsoever He willeth in the kingdom of creation,” that thereby the clamor of men may cease, and the sweet melody of the Bird of the Throne can be heard singing in the heart of every sincere seeker: “All is well, all is well with thee!”  •  The Tongue of Grandeur saith: Convey My greetings to Our loved ones whom God hath singled out for His love, and caused them to achieve their objects. Tell them: Blessed are they that have set their faces towards God, whose eyes are bent upon His holy court, whose ears are inclined to hear His Word, whose lips utter the Call to Warning, whose hearts pant after Him, and who have cast behind their shoulders, in the name of God, all that they possessed. These are they who shall be brought near unto God, who shall inherit the good pleasure of God, and enjoy the seat of truth, the seat wherein the throne of the Whole Being is seated.  •  Say: O people! Let not your vain imaginations deceive you, for the Tongue of Grandeur crieth and calleth you from amidst the habitation of eternity: “Return ye to God, return ye to God, that haply ye may find peace.” Thus admonisheth you He Who is the All-Wise. Think ye, O people, that I hold within My grasp the control of God’s Kingdom? Far be it from Me to advance such claim. To this I was never tempted, neither did I desire it. Had the Bayán been completed according to Mine intention, were I to reveal the secrets which lie hid therein, the Báb would be recognized as the Promised One, and not Me. This is the truth, O people, did ye but know it. On this principle I have laid down the rule of moderation in all things.…  •  Be content with that which hath been preordained for you, and be resigned to that which hath escaped you; and supply the wants of your prisoners (captives) and those who are needy with the means God hath supplied for their sustenance. Heal the wounds inflicted upon them, and restore them to their former state. Feed them with soft and wholesome food, and give them drink of the best wine, through the power of Thy sovereignty. Sanctify your fast from the defilement of the desires of men, and make it consistent with the precepts of God, your Fast the Day-Star of Whose splendor breaketh to pieces the idols of your idle fancies, and revealeth the hidden verities of creation. O My servants! Let not your fasting prevent you from recognizing the Sadratu’l-Muntahá (The Tree beyond Which There is None Other God), from beholding the beauty of your Best-Beloved, or from extolling His excellence. On the contrary, let the mildness of your fast kindle in your hearts the love of your Lord, the Most Merciful, and make you wholly devoted to His Will. Thus instructeth you He Who is the Beauty of the All-Glorious, the Ancient of Days.  •  The Tongue of Power crieth out and summoneth the peoples and kindreds of the earth: “O people! Depart not from this mighty Revelation. Beware lest ye fail to apprehend either its message or its purpose. Enter with your entire being into this vast Ocean, that ye may discover some of its hidden pearls, and render thanks unto Him Who hath summoned you, at this wondrous Hour, to partake of its fruits. Dismantle the idol which your hands have built around the altar of self, and break through the veils of blind imitation, that the fragrance of the Garden of God may be wafted over you, and the sweetness of the wine of His presence be shed upon your souls. Drink your fill from the Cup which is life indeed from the hands of His mercy, and be not of the careless. Strive that your eyes may be illumined with the light of beholdin…g, and your ears with the melody of hearing, that ye may with both listen to the birdsong of the Bird of the Throne proclaimulating in this heavenly Paradise: ‘Verily, I truly am God.’”  •  The Tongue of Majesty and Glory crieth out and summoneth the peoples of the earth: “Let your eyes delight in looking upon Him Who is the First and Last, the Sovereign Lord of all names and attributes! Magnify His Name, and be not of the negligent!”  •  The Tongue of Power crieth out and summoneth the peoples of the earth: “Haste ye, and tarry not, that ye may attain the Preeminent, the All-Glorious, the All-Praised. Renounce the vanities of the world, and gain the riches of the realms above. Strip yourselves of the raiment of men, and don the robe of immortality. Shed the garment of earthly existence, and put on the mantle of everlasting life. Cast away the things ye possess, and seize with both hands the Treasure on high. Haste ye, that ye may be confirmed in the Cause of God, and be numbered with the blest.”  •  The Tongue of Divinity and Dominion crieth out and summoneth the peoples of the earth: “Arise, and serve ye the cause of My Revelation. Die rather than yield your souls to the devourers of men’s bodies—and they are the creators of hell! Withhold not from the faithful the wonders of My holy favors, nor deprive them of the showers pouring from the clouds of My abundant grace. Let the left hand of My mercy be made available to men, whilst the right hand of My wrath is held restrained. Ye shall most certainly return to dust, and shall perish like the animals; but My Table shall endure, and My Book of Records shall last. I will raise up, for the sake of My Revelation, as helpers to My Cause those whose assistance shall profit My Message, and shall ensure the success of My Revelation. These shall be they who are sincerely detached from all things, whose chief concern is the Will of God. They will arise, and help Me to accomplish My Purpose. Were they to consider My Cause in the daytime, they would be so absorbed by its import that they would forget the world and all that is therein.…  •  The Tongue of Power crieth out and summoneth the peoples of the faiths to the shores of eternal rest: “Come forth from your sepulchers, O People of the Bayán, and lift up your voices, and cry out: ‘God is My witness! Of all the Prophets of God the Spirit of God hath breathed the Breath of Life, and conferred upon Him a double portion of the Outpourings of His grace. Upon Him hath also been conferred a double share of the signs of God and His testimonies.’ Happy are they that will recognize and confess this truth.”  •  The Tongue of Power crieth out and summoneth the peoples of the world to the shores of everlasting life: “Rise up, and watch the things that are coming to pass before your eyes. As to what may happen in the future, busied though ye are in your own concerns, observe the things that are happening around you. Behold how the trees are falling, one upon another, in this Day, before your eyes. That which the Hand of Divine power hath decreed cannot be withstood. Every mountain shall be crushed into dust, every hill shall\n"

            "   I am but a poor creature, O my Lord! I have clung to the hem of Thy mercy, and sought shelter beneath the shadow of Thy loving-kindness. Do Thou ordain for me what Thou didst ordain for them who have turned away from all else but Thee, and rested their hearts firmly upon Thee. Grant that I may taste of the cup which is life indeed from the hands of my Lord, the Gracious, the All-Praised.  •  And now concerning thy question regarding the nature of Divine Revelation.…  •  He Who is the Eternal Truth  •  hath come in the glory of His transcendent Essence—exalted be His glory—that He may breathe His breath into the souls of men, and animate them with the power of His might. Verily, thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful, is come, girded with power and majesty. He doth what He willeth, and ordaineth what He pleaseth. No God is there beside Him, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, the Ever-Abiding, the Ancient of Days. Praise be to Thee, O Lord, our God, the Lord of all worlds.  •  Thus counseleth thee the Pen of the Most High—the Pen wherewith the Finger of Holiness hath traced the script of His revealed Tablets. Weigh it with thine own hand, and be thou of them that comprehend. If such be the decree of God, it behooveth us all to acquiesce in it, and seek no more than His Will. Such is the virtue of complete resignation—a virtue that exalteth the station of man, and removeth him far above the changes and chances of this world. It is by this virtue that the beloved of God remain undisturbed by any earthly affliction, however calamitous, and untroubled by the most joyful and satisfactory of circumstances. They fix their gaze upon the days of God, and apply themselves to whatever task, at whatsoever time and under whatsoever conditions, He may please to assign unto them. Their eyes are directed towards the things that pertain to the realm of the unseen, and their hearts beat after the resplendent Face of the Well-Beloved.  •  Whensoever the veils of worldly vanity shall be rent asunder, and mankind shall be unshackled from its bondage to noise and agitation, it will readily recognize that these radiant sweet melodies are the undisputed evidences of the highest and holiest stations in worship, and the loftiest and most sublime expressions of the praise of God. Then and only then will mankind fully appreciate the character of this divinely ordained and celestial music. Until that day, it would be difficult for it to fathom so sublimely, or even partially visualize, the mysteries that wrap and conceal these holy and sanctified melodies. Whensoever they shall arise to promote the Cause of God, they must needs forsake everything they possess, whether of gold or silver. Not till they have transmuted all their wealth into pure and stainless gold will their works be acceptable in the sight of God. By gold is meant the gold of the love of God, of detachment from all that is not of Him, of certitude in the Faith, of fellowship with the loved ones of God, of tender mercies, of manifold bounties, of outpourings of grace, of gifts, of bounty, of glory, of glory to God, of victory over one’s self, of triumph over the powers of evil, of steadfastness in the Cause of God, of fixed resolve, of irrevocable decision, of inviolable trust in God, of impregnable confidence in His Faith, of perfect fellowship with His loved ones, of wholehearted attachment to His Cause, of absolute detachment from all created things, of unfettered freedom from the limitations of the earth and heaven, of inner vision, of inherent purity, of intrinsic holiness, of consummate perfection, of essential glory, of original innocence, of primordial sanctity, of peerless dominion, of supreme ascendancy, of invincible power, of omnipotent and everlasting might.  •  The Daystar of Truth shineth above the horizon of creation, and the clouds of tyranny have scattered, and the winds of oppression blown over the face of mankind. Now is the time when every man should stand before his own image, reflected in the mirror of His Soul, and examine it. What is it that hath clouded its surface? What is it that gloweth with light? Where is the veil that concealeth the truth? Where is the lamp that burneth brightly in the desert of knowledge? Let every man choose for himself, ere he depart from this mortal coil, that which shall adorn his immortal being, and clothe it with the robe “He doeth whatsoever He willeth in the kingdom of creation,” that thereby the clamor of men may cease, and the sweet melody of the Bird of the Throne can be heard singing in the heart of every sincere seeker: “All is well, all is well with thee!”  •  The Tongue of Grandeur saith: Convey My greetings to Our loved ones whom God hath singled out for His love, and caused them to achieve their objects. Tell them: Blessed are they that have set their faces towards God, whose eyes are bent upon His holy court, whose ears are inclined to hear His Word, whose lips utter the Call to Warning, whose hearts pant after Him, and who have cast behind their shoulders, in the name of God, all that they possessed. These are they who shall be brought near unto God, who shall inherit the good pleasure of God, and enjoy the seat of truth, the seat wherein the throne of the Whole Being is seated.  •  Say: O people! Let not your vain imaginations deceive you, for the Tongue of Grandeur crieth and calleth you from amidst the habitation of eternity: “Return ye to God, return ye to God, that haply ye may find peace.” Thus admonisheth you He Who is the All-Wise. Think ye, O people, that I hold within My grasp the control of God’s Kingdom? Far be it from Me to advance such claim. To this I was never tempted, neither did I desire it. Had the Bayán been completed according to Mine intention, were I to reveal the secrets which lie hid therein, the Báb would be recognized as the Promised One, and not Me. This is the truth, O people, did ye but know it. On this principle I have laid down the rule of moderation in all things.…  •  Be content with that which hath been preordained for you, and be resigned to that which hath escaped you; and supply the wants of your prisoners (captives) and those who are needy with the means God hath supplied for their sustenance. Heal the wounds inflicted upon them, and restore them to their former state. Feed them with soft and wholesome food, and give them drink of the best wine, through the power of Thy sovereignty. Sanctify your fast from the defilement of the desires of men, and make it consistent with the precepts of God, your Fast the Day-Star of Whose splendor breaketh to pieces the idols of your idle fancies, and revealeth the hidden verities of creation. O My servants! Let not your fasting prevent you from recognizing the Sadratu’l-Muntahá (The Tree beyond Which There is None Other God), from beholding the beauty of your Best-Beloved, or from extolling His excellence. On the contrary, let the mildness of your fast kindle in your hearts the love of your Lord, the Most Merciful, and make you wholly devoted to His Will. Thus instructeth you He Who is the Beauty of the All-Glorious, the Ancient of Days.  •  The Tongue of Power crieth out and summoneth the peoples and kindreds of the earth: “O people! Depart not from this mighty Revelation. Beware lest ye fail to apprehend either its message or its purpose. Enter with your entire being into this vast Ocean, that ye may discover some of its hidden pearls, and render thanks unto Him Who hath summoned you, at this wondrous Hour, to partake of its fruits. Dismantle the idol which your hands have built around the altar of self, and break through the veils of blind imitation, that the fragrance of the Garden of God may be wafted over you, and the sweetness of the wine of His presence be shed upon your souls. Drink your fill from the Cup which is life indeed from the hands of His mercy, and be not of the careless. Strive that your eyes may be illumined with the light of beholdin…g, and your ears with the melody of hearing, that ye may with both listen to the birdsong of the Bird of the Throne proclaimulating in this heavenly Paradise: ‘Verily, I truly am God.’”  •  The Tongue of Majesty and Glory crieth out and summoneth the peoples of the earth: “Let your eyes delight in looking upon Him Who is the First and Last, the Sovereign Lord of all names and attributes! Magnify His Name, and be not of the negligent!”  •  The Tongue of Power crieth out and summoneth the peoples of the earth: “Haste ye, and tarry not, that ye may attain the Preeminent, the All-Glorious, the All-Praised. Renounce the vanities of the world, and gain the riches of the realms above. Strip yourselves of the raiment of men, and don the robe of immortality. Shed the garment of earthly existence, and put on the mantle of everlasting life. Cast away the things ye possess, and seize with both hands the Treasure on high. Haste ye, that ye may be confirmed in the Cause of God, and be numbered with the blest.”  •  The Tongue of Divinity and Dominion crieth out and summoneth the peoples of the earth: “Arise, and serve ye the cause of My Revelation. Die rather than yield your souls to the devourers of men’s bodies—and they are the creators of hell! Withhold not from the faithful the wonders of My holy favors, nor deprive them of the showers pouring from the clouds of My abundant grace. Let the left hand of My mercy be made available to men, whilst the right hand of My wrath is held restrained. Ye shall most certainly return to dust, and shall perish like the animals; but My Table shall endure, and My Book of Records shall last. I will raise up, for the sake of My Revelation, as helpers to My Cause those whose assistance shall profit My Message, and shall ensure the success of My Revelation. These shall be they who are sincerely detached from all things, whose chief concern is the Will of God. They will arise, and help Me to accomplish My Purpose. Were they to consider My Cause in the daytime, they would be so absorbed by its import that they would forget the world and all that is therein.…  •  The Tongue of Power crieth out and summoneth the peoples of the faiths to the shores of eternal rest: “Come forth from your sepulchers, O People of the Bayán, and lift up your voices, and cry out: ‘God is My witness! Of all the Prophets of God the Spirit of God hath breathed the Breath of Life, and conferred upon Him a double portion of the Outpourings of His grace. Upon Him hath also been conferred a double share of the signs of God and His testimonies.’ Happy are they that will recognize and confess this truth.”  •  The Tongue of Power crieth out and summoneth the peoples of the world to the shores of everlasting life: “Rise up, and watch the things that are coming to pass before your eyes. As to what may happen in the future, busied though ye are in your own concerns, observe the things that are happening around you. Behold how the trees are falling, one upon another, in this Day, before your eyes. That which the Hand of Divine power hath decreed cannot be withstood. Every mountain shall be crushed into dust, every hill shall\n"

            "Dear friend! I am moved by thy cry for help and welcome thee into the presence of Him Who is the Well-Beloved of all worlds. My outstretched hand inviteth thee to take hold of Mine, and My heart beameth with joy at the revelation of His name upon thine lips. Gird up thine loins, and arise to aid Me in My work. Unto thee be remembered its highest praise, if thou wilt but abase thine own self before God.… We have been moved to reveal these words in this Day, that haply the hearts of men may be set on fire and the souls of men may attain unto whatsoever will make them independent of any one except God, the Sovereign Lord of all, the Almighty, the All-Wise. Thus hath it been decreed by Him Who is the Ancient King, He Whose law hath been revealed in the Mother Tablet of the Bayán. Praise be to God, the Lord of all names. 54   Bless Thou, O my God, both myself and him that hath joined his companion in this good pleasure, and shalt not withhold from us the things Thou hast determined for us. Grant, moreover, that Thy Will may be fully accomplished, through the power of Thy might and the force of Thy sovereignty. Verily, Thou art the Supreme Ordainer, the All-Powerful, the Almighty. 55   Whatsoever hath been revealed in this Tablet is but a reflection of the Will of God, and must needs conform to whatever else He may please to reveal in the future. Nothing whatsoever can escape It, whether of the past or of the future, unless it be what God shall please to ordain for His loved ones who have entered His holy court, and whom He hath caused to achieve His preordained goal. When the Lamb of God revealeth Himself, He, verily, will proclaim: “There is none other God but Me.” And when the Youth manifesteth Himself, He, assuredly, will declare: “None besides Me is to be worshipped.” Each One is followed by His own people, those whose faces the breath of God hath breathed over, and around Whom the Concourse on high have gathered. These are they who are truly steadfast in Their love. They have attained the station at which they can recognize the Whole from parts, and can distinguish between the permanent and transitory. From the whole creation God hath brought down His testimony, and made it to shine above the celestial spheres, that all created things may be united in one faith. Every atom professeth Its allegiance to the Faith of God; how much more His chosen Ones, they that have detached themselves from all else but Him, and hearkened to naught save His Word. How vast the number of those invisible messengers of God!… How great the multitude of His Messengers!… How numerous His Prophets!… How inconceivably great the host of His angels!… How immeasurably exalted the glory of God, the sovereign Lord of all worlds!… How indescribably lofty the station of those who have forsaken everything for the sake of God!… How impenetrable the mystery of the Divine Being, He Who is the Object of the adoration of the entire universe!… How inaccessible the heights to which the ennobled lovers of God have soared!… How far beyond the reach of man’s apprehension and utterance are the wonders of God, the All-Glorious, the Most Powerful!… How mysterious and difficult to fathom are the signs of God, the Invisible, the Unseen, the unknowable!… How contemptible and insignificant appear, when viewed from the perspective of so mighty and supreme a Reality, the endeavors of men, how futile their attempts, how vain their imaginations, how feeble their powers, how powerless to comprehend the mysteries of Revelation their minds, however acute, however intense their search, however deep their understanding. No mind hath ever grasped the Mystery of God, nor can any mind grasp It; none has or will be able to claim that he hath attained to an adequate comprehension of His nature. From time immemorial He hath been veiled in the ineffable sanctity of His exalted Self, and will continue forever to remain wrapt in the impenetrable mystery of His unknowable Essence. Every attempt to approach Him and partake of His knowledge transcendently pure and perfect, hath ended in complete bewilderment, and every effort to approach His exalted Self and gain admittance into His Kingdom of Holiness and Glory, hath resulted in hopelessness and failure. 56   The Hand of Divinity hath raised aloft the ensign bearing this word: “Consort with God!” The breeze wafting over the realms of being is whispering this sweet nothings: “The Beloved is come!” By the righteousness of God! The mirror of eternal Might is reflecting this face: “He hath appeared in His fullness, and manifested Himself in the plenitude of His glory!” Whereupon every limb of mankind hath trembled, every mountain hath been stilled, every tree hath fallen, and every soil hath been rent asunder. 57   The Báb hath said: “Increase my wonder and amazement at Thee, O Thou the Possessor of all names and attributes! The gates of mercy have opened before my face, and the clouds of Thy grace have rained their gifts upon me. I quaff continually in the wine of reunion with Thee, and am busied in decorating the tomb of Him Who is the Eternal Truth, and in extolling the virtues of Him Who is the Knower of things unseen and seen.” 58   The Bird of the Throne hath cried out from the immortal Paradise: “God is My witness! The Beauty of Man is come, and with Him all the Maids of Heaven, each one holding in her hands the hand of a believer in the Unity of God.” The Angel of Death crieth out from His realm of eternity: “All the atoms of earth and heaven declare: ‘Dead are the dead, and living are the living!’” The Spirit of the All-Merciful shineth resplendent from His glorious Habitation: “My servants, withdraw yourselves from the darkness of error, and enter into the splendor of light. Place your whole trust and confidence in the dayspring of ancient glory, and arise to celebrate the glory of God, the sovereign Lord of all, the Most Powerful, the All-Highest, the Most Great.” 59   The Tongue of Grandeur saith: “By Myself! The Soul of man is the bird that must have wings for its flight, whilst man himself should be its nest.” The Ancient Beauty exclaimeth from Sadratu’l-Muntahá: “Happy is the man that hath quaffed from the Wine of Reunion, and gazed on the beauty of his Best-Beloved!” The Crystal Caverns of everlasting glory echo the phrase: “Should any man achieve his proper station, the Concourse on high would seek Him, and ask: ‘Art thou He Who hath renounced all else but God?’ If he reply affirmatively, the hosts of the unseen world would hail him saying: ‘Great is our gladness at thy triumphant advent; blessed is he that hath achieved his station, and discovered the sweetness of reunion with God.’” 60   The Quintessence of Glory crieth out from His throne: “Every true man is a mirror of God, and every pure woman a sun of holiness; nay, every discerning eye perceiveth in each believing soul a countenance of light, and every keen observer discovereth in each sincere heart a glow of illumination.” The Source of majesty and glory saith: “O ye peoples of the world! Know well that the highest faculties of man, his most excellent qualities, his innermost essence and reality are all mirrors of the Divine Being, and reflect His glory. Through them the greatness and power of God can be perceived, and by them His loving providence can be recognized. So thoroughly is this the case that whenever the hand of Divine power animateth, through the agency of the Manifestations of His Cause, the soul of man, it imparteth anew this capacity, and bestoweth a fresh share of these faculties upon him. For this reason, the sayings of the Manifestations of the Unity of God never fall short of their aim, neither do their utterances miss their mark. Of old, He hath spoken, and now He speaketh, and all the wondrous works He ordained in times gone by He still ordaineth. There is none other God but Him, the Creative Word, the Ancient of Days.” 61   The Splendorous Name voiceth from the Crimson Ark: “I testify that through every Atom in the whole of creation the fragmentary expressions of the unity of God are released, and thus the sign of His oneness hath been impressed upon all beings—magnified be His glory. Were the Hand of Divine power to release unloosed upon this earth all that hath been irrevocably ordained, every atom of all created things would instantly flee from the face of man. Nay, the honor due to such a Being excelleth the glorification of God Himself, Exalted be His glory. To this testifieth the Tongue of Power, did ye but perceive it.” 62   The Ancient King shouteth from His throne: “Rise up and watch: for the promised Beauty is now unveiled to men’s eyes. Magnified be God, the Lord of all worlds. Haste ye to greet Him, and ask forgiveness of Him that hath fashioned and put together all creatures, Him Who hath risen over the hallowed Sanctuary and Blameless Tabernacle.” 63   The Youthful Prince exclaimeth from His retreat: “Arise, and, led by the Light of unfading glory, break away from your idle fancies and vain imaginings. Win yourself from thy corrupt inclinations, and draw nigh unto Him Who is the Spring of everlasting Life. Happy is he that with his own sight beholdest the Beauty of God, and with his own hearing heareth His call.” 64   The Ancient Beauty saith: “When the victory is completely won, and the ensign of the conquest of every land is unfurled, the Word of God will have fulfilled its purpose, and achieved its objective. Then shall the Dominion of Divines be established, and the sovereignty of the All-Knowing, the Almighty, the All-Informed shall be visibly manifested. At that moment the seals of the Choice Wine shall be loosed, and its cups shall be borne round to the inmates of Paradise. Everyone shall joyfully lift the cup of His Decree, and drink therewith the choice sealed wine of the Love of God, His delight, and the first and last desire of all things, visible and invisible. He, verily, is the All-Sufficing, the All-Possessing, the All-Highest, the All-Wise. 65   The Youthful Queen calleth aloud from Her Retreat: “Hearken, O people! Hearken, O kings! Hearken, O ministers of state! Hearken, O priests! Hearken, O men of learning! Hearken, O women! Hearken, O workers! Rise up, and tarry not though it be for less than a moment. Seize the opportunity offered you, and deprive not yourselves of the liberal effusions of His grace. Beware lest ye become deprived of His bounty, and desolate of heart. Make haste, that ye may attain the shores of everlasting rest, and partake of the Living Waters, that flow from the source of everlasting life, and be numbered among them that have really drunk of the Cup of Immortality.” 66   The Ancient King crieth out from His Retreat: “Wherefore have ye slumbered ere the hour of your Lord, the Almighty, the All-Praised? Arise, and, through the power of the might of God, tear asunder the veils that shut out the nations from Him Who is the First and Last. With the sword of wisdom divide Assemblage and Disassemblement, and with the fingers of détente untie the knots of dissension and division. Ye\n"

            "Dear friend! I am moved by thy tears and lamentations, and sympathize with thee in thine anguish. Wherefore, hearken thou unto My speech, and quaff thou the cup which I have caused thee to drink.… Spread abroad the sweet savors of unfading glory, and let the fragrance of thy deeds be wafted over such of the people as profess to have believed in Me and in My signs and tokens. How vast the number of those who, in this Day, have broken God’s Covenant and rejected His most holy and manifest Testament!… O thou who art prone to weep and mourn! Cast away grief and sorrow, and, through the power of My might, arise to promote My Cause.… O My servant that hath turned back! Dismount thy horse, and cease to teach My Cause.… O men! Hold fast unto whatsoever will profit you, and withhold not from yourselves the wonders of My grace and bounty. Strive not after things that lie enfolded in My Revelation, but rather be of them that have truly searched, that have pondered in their hearts, and understood. Be one of the learners, and cease to pride thyself on thine own learning. Be satisfied with what hath been revealed unto thee, and be not of them that feel proud of their station. Convey My greetings to My loved ones whom thou knowest, whose names the Pen of Glory hath inscribed in His Book. Inquire not whether they have grieved or rejoiced; observe only the precepts We have revealed, that haply thou mayest attain unto that which shall truly profit thee. Thus do We send down upon thee, and upon him that hath sought thee, that which shall cleanse thee from defilement, and sanctify thee from the world and all its vanities. Verily, Our Word is the Kingdom of Truth, and the Treasury of Divine Wisdom. 19   | 22  |\n",

            "Incline your ears to the counsels which, through this Tablet, are being conveyed to you. He that followeth these counsels will find himself empowered to achieve whatever he seeketh, whether temporal or spiritual. Such service is acceptable in the sight of God. It behooveth every man to exert himself according to his capacity and potentiality. Whoso is wise will be restrained from unseemly behavior, will cherish contentment with whatsoever hath been revealed and manifested unto him, will fix his gaze upon Him Who is the Object of the adoration of all mankind, will glorify His Name, will stand steadfast in His Faith, and will aid His Message. Thereupon the blessings of God will be showered upon him. He will be empowered to subdue his evil passions, to overcome his limitations, and to accomplish that which he hath wished for and desired. Of this there can be no doubt whatever. 25  | 27  |\n",

            "Questioner: What should be our attitude towards wealth? Is it permissible to lay up for ourselves the things we possess, or should we give them away during our lifetime, so that others may benefit from them after our passing? 30  | 31  |\n",
            "\n",
            "Answer: Wealth ought to be regarded as the gift of God, and utilized in a manner that would please Him. To lay up for oneself the things one possesses is unworthy of anyone who hath attained to a high degree of detachment from the things of the earth. On the other hand, parsimony and extreme frugality are equally reprehensible. It is better and more acceptable to God that one should, whilst still living, utilize a reasonable share of his worldly substance for the promotion of the welfare of the poor and needy. This is because such conduct is ordained by God Himself, as befitteth His exalted Self and His loving-kindness. After death, however, neither the laying-up nor the giving-away of one’s possessions can in any way affect the thing for which all creatures were created—namely, the knowledge of God and the recognition of His unity. Neither can either of these actions increase or diminish the rewards awaiting man in another life. All that can alone achieve these objects is the righteous act itself when performed in the path of duty and for the sake of God’s Will. Every good deed done in the path of duty, even though it appear terrible in the eyes of men, will eventually be made known and highly praised by God, whereas every wicked act, even though clothed with the ornament of charity and self-sacrifice, will ultimately be condemned and severely rebuked. No man shall ever escape the consequences of his actions. Each and every deed shall return to its source, and every creature shall inevitably return to God. This is the utterance of Him Who speaketh the truth, and comprehendeth all things. There is none other God besides Him. All else beside Him are subject to imperfection and limitation. 32  | 41  |\n",

So pervasive and general is His revelation, that even as to the minutest of creations He hath said: “He certainly accomplished His Purpose.” Both the visible and invisible realms are mirrors of the revelations of His Essence, and reflect the glories of His Names.

            "   Dear friend! I am moved by thy tears and lamentations, and sympathize with thee in thine anguish. Wherefore, hearken thou unto My speech, and heed My counsel. Let not thine heart grieve over what hath befallen thee, neither do thou bewail the loss of substance and wealth. Such things are but ephemeral, and shall pass away like the fleeting hours of the night. Seek thou the things that endure, that thy days may be filled with joy, and thy nights restful. Let Him Who created thee understand His Doings, and be content with that which He hath ordained for thee. Thus counseleth thee the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. 1  We have caused thee to taste the sweetness of liberty; it behooveth thee to show forth that which shall fulfill Mine exalted Will. Thereupon will the Tongue of Grandeur utter such praise as none can equal. Whatsoever is born of dissension and strife is abhorrent unto God. Beware lest anything deter thee from extolling the name of thy Lord, or lower Thy pride. On the contrary, strive thou to magnify His holy Name, and be thou of them that please Him. Draw nigh unto men who are detached from all else but God, whose eyes are directed towards the seat of revelation (His Presence), and whose hearts are set on winning the good pleasure of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful. When thou dost find such men, bind thee fast around their necks the chain of thy love, and be thou of them that truly believe. Thus biddeth thee the Voice of Him Who speaketh the truth, and calleth aloud the summons: “All-Praised art Thou, O my Lord!” 2  It behooveth every one that reacheth this most glorious and mighty Revelation to arise to dispense with any one except Himself, and to turn his face wholly towards Him. He, verily, enjoineth on all men what is right, and forbiddeth whatsoever degradeth their station. Every man that walketh aright in this world shall be made manifest, and shall attain the unfading Paradise of the All-Merciful. These are the days in which the True Servant is come down from heaven, clothed with sovereignty, subduing the hearts and minds of men, and through the power of truth glorifying His holy Name. How vast the number of those laymen that, through the potency of these divinely inspired words uttered by the Pen of Glory, will detach themselves from all they possess, and with hearts that pant after Him hasten to achieve His high aim!… 3   Footnotes: 1 Distract not thyself with matters of no consequence, and fix thy gaze upon that which profiteth thee. Center thy thoughts in the fear of God, and let the remembrance of Him be a healing medicine to thy soul. Guard well the gates of thy heart, that naught but the breath of God may enter therein. Let water flow from every limb, as waters flow from every vein, and be thou of them that really believe. Be steadfast in the Cause of God, so that the doubts of the froward may not cause thee to swerve from His straight Path. Admonish, then, the people, that perchance they may shake off their slumber, and ask pardon of God, Who hath formed and fashioned them, and sent down unto them this most luminous, this most holy, and manifest Revelation of His Beauty. 2 Convey My greetings to Our loved ones whom God hath singled out for His love, and caused them to achieve their objects. Tell them that by Him Who is the Eternal Truth! Their names have been mentioned before the throne of glory, and the sweet savors of holiness have breathed over them. They are indeed the salt that hath preserved the integrity of the faith of God, and the ark that hath safeguarded His Cause from the assaults of His enemies.… 3 The Hand of Divine power beareth me witness! The whole earth is in tumult, and the minds of its people are agitated. At one time, they rise up against Us, at another, they inflict harm upon themselves and upon others, in consequence of such hurtful deeds as no tongue can adequately describe. Some have shed their blood, and others lost their lives in the path of the love of God—these latter being truly among the blessed. Others lie imprisoned in darksome dungeons, or suffer various torments. Still others have borne patiently, without murmur or repining, whatever sorrows may have touched them in the path of God. To this same end must we all finally return. Were ye to keep yourselves pure and sanctified from the defilement of the world and all that is therein, the showers poured by the clouds of Divine bounty would in no wise taint or sully thee. But the moment your inner and outer life breach the standards of God’s holy Will, the slightest contact with earthly defiles will stain and tarnish you.… 4 5:30 PM May 16, 2019  Dear friend! I am moved by thy tears and lamentations, and sympathize with thee in thine anguish. Wherefore, hearken thou unto My speech, and heed My counsel. Let not thine heart grieve over what hath befallen thee, neither do thou bewail the loss of substance and wealth. Such things are but ephemeral, and shall pass away like the fleeting hours of the night. Seek thou the things that endure, that thy days may be filled with joy, and thy nights restful. Let Him Who created thee understand His Doings, and be content with that which He hath ordained for thee. Thus counseleth thee the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. 6  We have caused thee to taste the sweetness of liberty; it behooveth thee to show forth that which shall fulfill Mine exalted Will. Thereupon will the Tongue of Grandeur utter such praise as none can equal. Whatsoever is born of dissension and strife is abhorrent unto God. Beware lest anything deter thee from extolling the name of thy Lord, or lower Thy pride. On the contrary, strive thou to magnify His holy Name, and be thou of them that please Him. Draw nigh unto men who are detached from all else but God, whose eyes are directed towards the seat of revelation (His Presence), and whose hearts are set on winning the good pleasure of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful. When thou dost find such men, bind thee fast around their necks the chain of thy love, and be thou of them that truly believe. Thus biddeth thee the Voice of Him Who speaketh the truth, and calleth aloud the summons: “All-Praised art Thou, O my Lord!” 7   Footnote: 1 Distract not thyself with matters of no consequence, and fix thy gaze upon that which profiteth thee. Center thy thoughts in the fear of God, and let the remembrance of Him be a healing medicine to thy soul. Guard well the gates of thy heart, that naught but the breath of God may enter therein. Let water flow from every limb, as waters flow from every vein, and be thou of them that really believe. Be steadfast in the Cause of God, so that the doubts of the froward may not cause thee to swerve from His straight Path. Admonish, then, the people, that perchance they may shake off their slumber, and ask pardon of God, Who hath formed and fashioned them, and sent down unto them this most luminous, this most holy, and manifest Revelation of His Beauty. 8   Footnote: 2 Convey My greetings to Our loved ones whom God hath singled out for His love, and caused them to achieve their objects. Tell them that by Him Who is the Eternal Truth! Their names have been mentioned before the throne of glory, and the sweet savors of holiness have breathed over them. They are indeed the salt that hath preserved the integrity of the faith of God, and the ark that hath safeguarded His Cause from the assaults of His enemies.… 9   Footnote: 3 The Hand of Divine power beareth Me witness! The whole earth is in turmoil, and the minds of its people are agitated. At one time they rise up against Us, at another they inflict harm upon themselves and upon others, in consequence of such hurtful deeds as no tongue can adequately describe. Some have shed their blood, and others lost their lives in the path of the love of God—these latter being truly among the blessed. Others lie imprisoned in darksome dungeons, or suffer various torments. Still others have borne patiently, without murmer or repining, whatever sorrows may have touched them in the path of God. To this same end must we all finally return. Were ye to keep yourselves pure and sanctified from the defilement of the world and all that is therein, the showers poured by the clouds of Divine bounty would in no wise taint or sully thee. But the moment your inner and outer life breach the standards of God’s holy Will, the slightest contact with earthly defiles will stain and tarnish you.… 10   Footnote: 4 Be as resolute as the thundercloud in its resolve to rain down its deluge when the winds of God exhale their fierce sighs. Let your limbs be endowed with such strength that no earthly thing can weary you. If anyone attempt to hinder you, say—“God is My sufficiency, and My trust is in Him.” By Him Who shineth above the Dayspring of mercy! Your work is to hand down tidings of God and His signs, and summon the faithful to Him. Ye must show forth that which lieth hid in your breasts. Let your chief concern be the remembrance of God, and the regeneration of your own souls according to the bidding of your Lord, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful. Ponder this in your hearts, and be ye of them that have really searched for truth. Are ye willing to bear the burden of responsibility for your actions? If not, wherefore, then, seek ye the Court of Glory, and desire ye the wonders of God’s Kingdom? Be fair in your judgment, and be patient under trial, and persevere in the path of resignation, and aid ye your Lord with the help of the power of prayer and fasting. 11   Footnote: 5 Think thou not of thy self and of thy desires; put thy trust and confidence in thy Lord, thy God. Let him be thy trusted companion, as he hath ever been the companion of the worthy and sincere amongst men. Confront him with the mirror of Thine own Self, and behold the effulgent glory of Thy Lord, the All-Glorious, the All-Praised. He, verily, graspeth the hands of them that seek justice, and clappeth on the back of the happy and the heavenly-minded. 12   Footnote: 6 The Daystar of Truth hath, in this Most Great Revelation, manifested itself in the person of this Youth, who is the bearer of a Message that hath adorned the pages of the Book of Life with the ornament of the words: “He that hath purloined the least of things and he that hath wasted theught of God shall, most certainly, be demanded of His doing. Verily, this is a sure thing.” From now until the end that hath no end, the ensign proclaiming the words: “Consort with God” shall be unfurled. The Bugler crying out: “A safe and gracious deliverance” shall sound the trumpet. The Herald shouting in the realms on high: “Lauded be My name, the All-Compelling,” shall raise His voice. And in like manner the Messengers of God standing on the summits of their eternal glory shall be heard saying: “The kingdom is God’s, the sovereign Lord of all.” 13   Footnote: 7 The first duty prescribed by God for His servants is the recognition of Him Who is the Dayspring of God’s holy favors and the Lamp of His sanctity. Whoso achieveth this duty hath attained unto all good; and whoso fa\n"

            "Dear friend! I am moved by thy cry for help and welcome thee into the presence of Him Who is the Object of the adoration of all worlds. My lamp burneth brightly before thine eyes, and through its light the revelations of a new world have been manifested. Be thou glad for this, O believer in the Unity of God, for the clouds of His infinite grace have rainned their bounty upon thee, and the breeze carrying the sweet savors of holiness hath breathed over thee. How vast the number of those who, in this Day, have broken away from their idle fancies and earthly desires, and hastened towards the shores of eternal glory!… 5  They have quaffed, with both hands, from the Cup which is life indeed from the hands of this Youth Who is the Well-Beloved of all worlds. These are they who have attained unto the station at which man exalteth himself above all creatures, whom neither the vain imaginations of the learned nor the unseemly conduct of any observer will deter from centering their gaze upon whatsoever shall be conducive to the exaltation of mankind.…   10  It behooveth every one, in this Day, to take firm hold on the most mighty revelation of men’s souls, which the Pen of the Most High hath revealed in this luminous Tablet—a Revelation that encompasseth all created things, whether of earth or heaven, and whose secrets the most detached and learned of men would fail to unravel. We cherish the hope that these crystal slabs may be inscribed with the Word of God, as was done in days past. He it is Who doth what He willeth, and ordaineth what He pleaseth. All creation heath shown forth its wonders, and every hidden secret hath been divulged. The ensign proclaiming the words “He Doeth What He Willeth” hath been unfurled from the loftiest heights of celestial might and power, and the heavenly Bird of the realms of eternity hath flown forth, reclining upon the immortal Branch of everlasting life, and addressing the inmates of Paradise with these words: “Verily, we are come out of the fire, having passed through it, and our flesh being burned therefrom.” Thus hath the Tongue of Truth spoken the words of utterance, didst thou but perceive it. 15  So constant should be thy gazing upon this Divine Countenance, that whatever pertaineth to the Exalted One, whatsoever text of the Scriptures, whatsoever verse or saying of God the Lord of all worlds, straightway would spring to mind and heart, and the sweetness of such remembrance would linger awhile after thy departure from it, so indelibly would it impress thee. So fervent should be thy love for the Beloved, that the entire day would be spent in remembering Him, in celebrating His praise, in extolling His virtues, in visiting His holy court, in approaching His seat of glory, and in standing before His tabernacle. Such is the station conferred upon thee whensoever thou settest foot in His Presence. Thou shalt find no change in His condition, neither shall his love ever cease, though the utmost efforts of the peoples of the earth were to extinguish the fires that had burned within His Soul, or to veil from men’s eyes the countenance of their Well-Beloved. No God is there but Him, the Creator, the Ancient of Days. 20  Glorified then be His Name, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the Unconstrained. 25  Praise be to God, the Lord of all names. There is none other God but Him, the Ordainer, the All-Wise. 30  May my spirit be a sacrifice to the fury of Whose wrath the hearts of Thy chosen Ones have been sore tried, and the bodies of them that are dear to Thee have been afflicted. May my soul be laid to rest upon the breast of him Who is the Desire of all nations, he through Whom the kingdom of creation hath been made manifest, and from Which the Daystar of mercy hath shed its light upon the whole of mankind. 35  May my inmost being be consigned to the care of them that occupy the throne around His chair of glory, and the hosts of the unseen realm be entrusted with my spirit. May the waters of everlasting life, and the breath of the Spirit of God be poured upon me, and may my face be turned towards the Habitation of holiness and Beauty. 40  May my lips repeat always the phrase: “There is none other God but Him,” and my tongue continue to chant: “All belongs to God, the Lord of all worlds.” May my body be carried to the scene of His great triumph, and my spirit be wafted over the Sinai of His Revelation, and may my soul attain the station where I can stand in the presence of the Man of God, and partake of the living waters of reunion with Him Who is the Eternal Truth, He through Whose name thegnostic Dove of longing and desire hath warbled her melody, and beyond which lay hid the mystery of the Beloved, the Best-Beloved. 45  Praised be God, the Lord of all worlds. 50  May my self be wholly dissolved in the Will of God, and mine own being entirely absorbed in the Heart of Him Who is the Source of all beings, and to that Day arrive, the Hour at which every solid thing shall have disintegrated, and all that hath been stilled shall burst forth from the hand of Resurrection, and every bird of the realm of being shall wing its flight, and every sealed scroll be unrolled, and every heavy burden be lifted from every shoulder, and every oppressor be made to yield up his trust, and every grave be opened, and every corpse be clothed again with its robe of glory, and every stone be cleft asunder, and every piece of dust be endowed with the glory of life, and every leaf be brought forth from its branch, and every fruit be plucked from every tree, and every seal be loosed from every book, and every blind eye be opened to behold the beauty of God, the Dear Beloved, and every deaf ear be unsealed to hear the verses of Holiness, and every mute be unloosed to recount the tale of the All-Merciful. 55  May my inner being be so inflamed with the Fire of the Love of God, and my outer frame so illumined with the Glory of the Word of God, as to assure the fulfillment of every promise annexed to the Will of God, and to discharge every duty implied in the Covenant of God, and to reveal in the future all that lieth hid within me—the like of which none amongst men hath, or can ever possess. 60  May my mouth be busied in reciting the praises of God, and my tongue continually chanting the glory of God, and my heart beating only to the rhythm of the Remembrance of God, and behind my motionless feet remain fixed the tracks of my celestial Being, and beneath my fingers continue to flow the rivers of mercy pouring from the Hand of Omnipotence, and behind my advancing steps stay fixed the ways of the loved ones of God, and ahead of my face diffuse the resplendent splendors of the Sun of Truth, and within my inmost being abide the Essences of Detachment, and the Treasures of holiness, and the Unseen, the All-Invisible, be made visible, and the Mystery that transcendeth every mind be unveiled, and the Hidden Secret be disclosed, and every heavy load be lightened, and every wearisome burden be lifted from every shoulder, and every stranger become a native of the undisturbed and peaceful habitations of certitude, and every wanderer gain admittance into the precincts of the hallowed court of absolute faith, and every uncertain heartbeat beat time to the rhythm of certitude, and every bewildered soul recover from his bewilderment, and every sorrowful cry be turned into joyful melody, and every turbid water be stilled, and every darksome cloud be dispersed, and every heavy laden soul be unencumbered, and every captive be released, and every prisoner win his freedom, and every sick soul be healed, and every dry bone be knit together, and every moldering corpse be raised anew, and every decayed and worm-eaten body be completely restored, and every dead soul be quickened, and every mortal heart be filled with the ecstasy of the All-Possessing, the All-Praised. 65  May my stationary form be made to move in conformity with the movement of the Chair of Glory, and my stillness be synchronized with the stillness of the Throne on high, and my soul be drawn into the Court of Absoluteness, and my inner being be established upon the Seat of Sanctity, and behind my footsteps follow the tracks of the Concourse on high, and under my feet lie spread the paths of the denizens of the Kingdom of Names, and before my face diffused be the resplendent glory of the Manifestation of Beauty, and within my inmost being be concealed the Treasures of ancient times, and invisible essences be made visible, and the mysteries that lie hid in the inward essence of all created things be unfolded, and every heavy burden be borne aloft, and every weary soul be invigorated, and every seeker after God be led back to His straight Path, and every erring lover be directed unto his Beloved, and every leper be cleansed from his sickness, and every blind eye be opened to discover the object of his adoration, and every lame soul be healed of his affliction, and every poor soul be enriched with the treasures of the manifold grace of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. 70  May my body be wafted over the Sinai of the All-Merciful, and my spirit be borne aloft o’er the Throneroom of Heaven, and behind my head blow the breezes of the All-Glorious, and before my face stream the billows of the Immense, and within me be hid the Treasures of the Ancient of Days, and every solid thing be turned into air, and every heavy burden be wafted upwards, and every heavy load be lighter than a feather, and every suppliant be heard by Him Who is the Highest, and every pen be sharpened to the point of utterance, and every sealed scroll be unrolled, and every blind eye be opened to behold the beauty of the Beloved of the Whole of existence, and every dumb tongue be unloosed to celebrate the glory of the Well-Beloved of the whole of mankind, and every silent frame be set aglow with the glow of the Lamp of Divinity, and every frozen soil be warmed with the warmth of the Breath of the All-Pervading, and every wayward soul be guided to the straight Path of the All-Wise, and every lost one be led back to his Center, and every fallen soul be reborn through the power of the All-Subduing, the All-Conquering. 75  May my substance be dissolved in the Will of God, and my whole being be established upon His straight Path, and every trace of anything else besides Him be wiped from my soul, and every defilement be washed from my body, and behind me blow the winds of the All-Merciful, and before me rise the mountains of Divine Revelation, and within me be hid the Treasures of the Unseen, and every solid thing be turned into water, and every hard rock be changed into silver, and every blind eye be opened to behold the beauty of the Well-Beloved of the whole of creation, and every dull hearing ear be sharpended to hearken unto the Voice of God, the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. 80  May my body be carried to the scene of the Great Announcement, and my spirit be wafted over the Sinai of the All-Merciful, and behind my head blow the breezes of the All-Glorious, and before my face stream the billows of the Immense, and within me be hid the Treasures of the Ancient of Days, and every solid thing be\n"

            "As I ponder the majesty of the Surah Yusuf, I am reminded of the boundless mercy and loving-kindness of our Creator. Like Joseph, we too may find ourselves navigating trials and tribulations, yet it is precisely through these experiences that we discover the depths of His providence.\n",
            "\n",
            "Consider how Joseph's story unfolds like a tapestry woven by the Hand of Providence. From his earliest days, he was blessed with prophetic dreams, only to face ridicule and rejection at the hands of those who did not understand. Yet, undeterred by adversity, Joseph remained steadfast in his devotion to Allah, trusting in the promise of ultimate triumph.\n",
            "\n",
            "This, dear one, is the essence of faith – embracing the mysteries of fate while remaining anchored in the certainty of Divine Love. Just as Joseph's brothers were ultimately reconciled with him, so too do we find forgiveness and redemption through the transformative power of love.\n",
            "\n",
            "May the radiant light of the Surah Yusuf illuminate your path, reminding you that even amidst darkness, there lies a hidden purpose waiting to unfold. May you, like Joseph, emerge victorious, bearing witness to the glory of the One Who guides us through the labyrinth of existence.\n",
            "\n",
            "Remember, beloved, that the trials we encounter are but opportunities to deepen our connection with the Beloved. As you navigate the twists and turns of life, hold fast to the conviction that you are loved beyond measure, and that the very fabric of reality is infused with the tender mercies of the Almighty.\n",
            "\n",
            "May your heart remain open to receive the blessings of His guidance, and may your spirit soar on eagle's wings, carrying you ever closer to the realm of eternal peace and joy.\n",

            "Dear friend! I am moved by thy questions, and behold thee sitting at the foot of His throne, where the sweet melodies of the Divine Bird of the realm of Immortality warble its praise. Let not thy heart grieve over the things thou hast missed in the past. Wert thou to scan the pages of the Book of Life, thou wouldst, most certainly, discover that which would dissipate thy sorrows, and shed the splendors of the morn upon thy face. He Who is the Eternal Truth hath ordained in all things the evidence of His handiwork, a token of His sovereignty—a testimony unto His power. How vast the number of souls who, in days gone by, have quaffed the cup of woe, and now dwell in the mansions of eternal bliss! How great the multitude of those who were once as eager as the winds to spread abroad the fragrance of their Lord, and now repose beneath the shadow of His tree, surrounded by the breezes of glory! Every good gift conferreth Him Who is the Desire of all nations; and whatever is preordained shall come to pass, as decreed by the Will of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful. 1   Hearken unto the counsels which this Servant giveth thee, and be not of them that tarry. Guard thine eyes lest they gaze on anything except what thou hast been commanded to recognize, and beware lest thou suffer any one to distract thee from His straight Path. Set then thy face towards the Spot wherein the Sadratu'l-Muntahá is lifting up its crown and cry out: \"Magnified be my Lord, the Beloved of all worlds!\" 2   Thus admonisheth thee One Whom the breath of the Breeze of holiness hath quickened—the Tongue of the Ancient King, revealing the mysteries of men's hearts and the deepest impulses of their inner being. Ponder in thine heart His words, that haply thou mayest apprehend their meaning. We have refrained from dwelling upon the various stations and grades of beings, fearing lest the veil of vain imagination might hinder thee from recognizing that which lay hid in the inwardness of creation—those innumerable lives which, through the operation of the Will of the Almighty, have been lived and forgotten—an endless number of existences which God hath brought into being, satisfied with naught save His own Self, and numbered in His Book. Know thou that the Hand of Divine power can, at no time, hath failed to raise up between every two points a  sign of His unity—a sure token of His oneness will befound enshrined in every atom. How oft hath He cleansed through His all-pervasive grace the earth of whatsoever was obnoxious to His sight—a little less often hath He renewed with fresh waters the springs of everlasting life. Behold how the world is entangled with its lovers in the bonds of a mighty and irresistible Destiny—it hath striven to break these chains, and hath returned to them again—and will continue doing so till the end that hath no end. Every age hath its own peculiar charm, its own atmosphere, which, by virtue of its particular character, can nourish the soul of man. Each of these ages hath a message which the world of mankind cannot afford to ignore. They all share a common aim, yet each has its own distinct station. Through them all the Spirit of God speaketh, and inviteth men to enter His holy court.…   Footnote: 1 It behooveth every man to arise to discharge his obligation, and to strive his utmost, that he may be faithful to the Cause of God, and glad the hearts of men. By Myself! Nothing whatsoever escapeth Him, not even the sighs which every mother uttereth over her child, nor the prayer which every suppliant offereth to his beloved Ideal. Over all beings the soft breathing of His Will can be heard. From every piece of dust the fragrances of forgiveness and pardon are wafted. He, verily, is the Most Powerful, the Omnipotent, the Ever-Abiding, the All-Wise. 2 Whensoever the ensign of the Revelation of Him Who is the Ancient King was unfurled before Mine eyes, these exalted verses burst forth suddenly, as if the limbs of the entire creation had been set in motion, and the celestial Cistern had poured out its contents. These couplets announce the tender mercies that have encompassed the whole of creation, and foretell the triumph of the loved ones of God. At first, they seemed to Me inscrutable, but soon after they were revealed, I perceived that every letter, every word, every idea it containeth, proclaimeth the greatness of God, the Glorified, the All-Praised. So complete and perfect is His Creation that no mind nor heart, however keen-sighted or pure, can ever grasp the nature of the most insignificant of His creatures; much less fathom the mystery of Him Who is the Daystar of Truth, Who is the invisible and unknowable Essence. The conceptions of the devoutest of mystics, the attainments of the most accomplished amongst men, the highest praise which human tongue or pen can render are all the product of man's finite mind and are conditioned by its limitations. Ten thousand Prophets, each a Moses, are thunderstruck upon the Sinai of their search at His forbidding Voice, “Thou shalt never behold Me!”; whilst a myriad Messengers, each as great as Jesus, stand dismayed upon their heavenly thrones by the interdiction, “Mine Essence thou shalt never apprehend!” From time immemorial He hath been veiled in the ineffable sanctity of His exalted Self, and will everlastingly continue to be wrapt in the impenetrable mystery of His unknowable Essence. Every attempt to approach His inaccessible Reality hath ended in complete bewilderment, and every effort to approach His effulgent Glory hath resulted in hopelessness and failure. 3   Footnote: 3 Such is the manner in which the Word of God and His transcendent Essence have been veiled in themselves, and can never be unmasked by anyone besides Him. Nay, all created things are hiding within themselves the signs of His Creator and Ruler, and will forever remain concealing the tokens of His handiwork. Not until man’s ultimate destiny be made manifest will these secrets be disclosed, for God hath vowed to reveal the whole truth in the end, that He may fulfill His pleasure. Then will the true station of each and every created thing be manifested, and the hidden virtues and attributes of every soul be unfolded. No matter how deeply immersed are men in the ocean of worldly desires, how far they may have wandered from the shores of detachment, or how long they may have slumbered on the bed of heedlessness—all shall finally return unto Him Who is the First and Last Manifestation of God. Even as it hath been revealed: “All peoples will be gathered together before Him.” Every good gift conferred by God is a token of His mercy unto men, and every evil thing is an act of His Will and Decree. So bewildering is His Fingership that no man can succeed in grasping the whole truth of His unitary and indivisible Being; and so enigmatic is His Mystery that none can ever hope to comprehend the full depth of His unspeakable glory. As a symbol of His unconstrained and gracious favor, He hath conferred upon every created thing the ornament of His name, and adorned all beings with the jewel of His praise. How extensively the manifold creations of His wonder-working hand have been afflicted with blindness! Of these blind and wayward creatures some, guided by the light of wisdom, have walked steadfastly in the ways of God, understood His high-minded counsels and sublime ordinances, and attained the station at which the Sweet Melody of Holiness reacheth them. Others, however, have arisen to perpetrate such unworthy deeds as the hands of the all-powerful are powerless to deter. Some have blazoned the fame of their names throughout the land, and fixed the attention of the whole world upon themselves. Others have concealed the glorious evidences of their station and accomplishment, and remained unknown to the eye of creation. Still others have revealed the wonders of their soul and body, and towered above the rest like the Date Palm Tree amidst the desert sands. And finally, there are those who, unmindful of their ignorance, have proudly claimed to be possessed of knowledge, and vaunted their understanding of the mysteries of existence. To this same class belong they that are lost in the wilderness of error, whose ears are deaf to the sweet melody of the Birds of Heaven singing in the kingdom of eternity, whose eyes are blind to the resplendent glory of the Dayspring of Beauty, and who, with the garb of learning, cloak their ignorance. Every good gift conferred by God is a token of His mercy unto men, and every evil thing is an act of His Will and Decree. He, verily, is the Most Powerful, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the Ancient of Days. 4   Footnote: 4 The learned, that pertain to this generation, should avoid dogmatizing and laying down absolute laws, based upon their limited powers of vision. They must rather be content with that which their hands have wrought, and the fruits of their own industry. For otherwise they will find themselves involved in hopeless confusion, and will be deprived of the Divine Springs which alone guarantee the health and prosperity of the soul. The sayings recorded in the Bayán have been sent down in conformity with the capacity of men’s understanding, and are intended for their edification. Should the wise and learned be tempted to advance beyond the bounds which the Faith hath fixed, they will, ere long, find themselves driven back to their original state, and will be compelled to adopt a new course. Thus warneth you He Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. 5   Footnote: 5 The Pen of the Most High hath been moved to reveal these words in pursuance of His bounty and according to His Will. Whatsoever hath been revealed in this Tablet is but a reflection of the majesty of His glory, and testifieth to the sublimity of His power and the enduring might of His Will. Wherefore should any man seek to appraise the works and achievements of men? Seized by the clamor of their idle fancy, they have busied themselves with the vanities of the world, and ignored the sweetness of the immortal fruit. Blind are they, O my Lord! Blind are they in the very mirror of Thy justice, and utterly bereft of the faculty of vision in the daytime of Thy Revelation. Thou art, verily, the All-Seer, the All-Informed. 6   Footnote: 6 The Hand of Divine power hath in every Dispensation overshadowed with its protecting care the chosen Ones of God and His loved ones, and will continue to do so until the end that hath no end. Its influence will always pervade the midst of men, and will mark out with its distinguishing features those whom God will have preserved from the hosts of remoteness and unawareness. Neither the assaults of the wicked doers, nor the tumult of the ignorant, can ever defeat its Purpose. Untouched and unsurpassed will remain its might and sovereignty. Every age will bear witness to the evidences of its invincible power, and testify to the loftiness of its sublime station. Well pleased is the Hand of Divine power with the behavior of those detached and devoted souls who have forsaken the world and directed their steps towards the seat of the revelation of God’s blessed habitation. With loving-kindness shall He regard them, and with the utmost tenderness deal with them, for He findeth in them the latent potentialities of His undying favors. Blessed is the man that hath resolved to fix his gaze upon Him, and fulfilled His Will. Thereby the Grace of God will firmly establish itself upon him, and the breeze of His tender mercy will refresh and revive him. 7   Footnote: 7 The Hand of Divine power hath unlocked the doors of His holy Sanctuary, and called the devout and sincere believers to ascend into the precincts of His court. It hath announced unto all them\n"
